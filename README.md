## Getting Started

![img.png](assets/use-this-template.png)

1. **Create a new repository**: Click the "Use this template" button to create a new repository based on this template.
2. **Clone the repository**: Clone your new repository to your local machine using Git.
3. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the cloned repository directory and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. **Fill in the theme information**:
   - Open `package.json` and fill in basic information such as the theme name, author, and description.
   - Open `src/css/license.css` and fill in the theme's license information.
   - If necessary, update the version information in `versions.json`.  
   - Finally, remember to modify the files under .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.
5. **Develop your theme**: Start modifying the CSS files in the `src/scss` directory to create your custom theme.
   - Use the `npm run dev` command to start the development server, so you can preview your theme changes in real-time.
   - Create a symbolic link to map the `test` directory to the `themes` directory in your Obsidian Vault for testing your theme in Obsidian.
   - If needed, you can modify the `.css.md` files in the `src/css/style-settings/` directory. They will generate configuration definitions for the Style Settings plugin for your theme.
   - Whenever you make changes to files in either the `src/scss` or `src/css/style-settings` directories, they will be automatically compiled into `theme.css` in the `test` directory (HMR).
6. **Build the theme**: Run `npm run build` to compile your SCSS files into CSS. This will generate the final theme files in root directory.


## Notes

- During development, it is recommended to use the `npm run dev` command to preview theme changes in real-time.
- The Style Settings configuration adopts a modular design. Each module consists of a `.css.md` file and a directory with the same name. The directory contains a set of configuration files. This theme template supports dynamically reading these configurations during development and compilation, but the final definition information for delivery will be generated based on the order of file names. Therefore, you can add a numeric prefix to each Section.

You can refer to more information in [the official documentation](https://docs.obsidian.md/Themes/App+themes/Build+a+theme)

## Style Settings

The Style Settings plugin allows snippet, theme, and plugin CSS files to define a set of configuration options. It then allows users to see all the tweakable settings in one settings pane. Style Settings allows both toggling classes on and off the body element, as well as setting numeric, string, and color CSS variables.

For more information on how to use Style Settings, please refer to [the official documentation](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings).

### Style Settings Definition

![Style Settings Definition](assets/style-settings-definition-files.png)

The image above shows the relationship between the Style Settings interface and the Style Settings definition files.

Theme designers and developers can fully utilize the `section.css.md file` and the configuration files in its identically named folder to modularly define the Style Settings interface, with only the sorting order of the files needing to be noted.

- You can use `#` as a comment. These comments will be included in `src/css/style-settings-definition.css`, and the Style Settings plugin will handle them correctly.

- You can also use `;` as a comment. These comments will be ignored when building `style-settings-definition.css`. You can make full use of this type of comment to improve the readability and maintainability of the definition files.

By using Style Settings Definition, you can avoid directly writing lengthy Style Settings CSS information.

In some theme project files, designers and developers may append adjustments to the Style Settings plugin interface under the Style Settings CSS information. I recommend placing these fine-tuning CSS snippets in `src/scss/plugins/style-settings.scss` to avoid being accidentally removed during automatic builds.

Remember, the style fine-tuning code for third-party plugins needs to be imported in `src/scss/index.scss` to ensure that they are correctly compiled into `theme.css`.

## Q&A

### Why can't my theme use HMR?

This theme template supports hot module replacement (HMR) from SCSS files to CSS files. If you find that HMR isn't working during development, it could be due to the following reasons:
1. During runtime, the test folder `test` isn't symbolically linked to `.obsidian/themes/<YOUR_THEME_NAME>`.
2. The `manifest.json` file in the runtime test folder `test` isn't configured correctly or has been accidentally deleted.
3. Obsidian doesn't have an HMR plugin installed (such as [obsidian-theme-hot-reload-plugin](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-theme-hot-reload-plugin/)) or the plugin isn't enabled.
4. The HMR plugin isn't configured correctly (for example, obsidian-theme-hot-reload-plugin requires manual addition of file monitoring).

### How to disable Style Settings definitions?

The theme template has Style Settings definitions enabled by default. If you don't need to use Style Settings, you can delete all `.css.md` files and their corresponding configuration directories in the `src/css/style-settings/` directory.

### How to Publish Your Theme?

After running `npm run build`, the `theme.css` and `manifest.json` files will be generated in the root directory. Then you can proceed with the publishing process.

There are two methods for publishing:

1. **Manual Publishing**. Publish directly through the GitHub Web UI.
   - Create a new Release on GitHub and upload the `theme.css` and `manifest.json` files.
   - Make sure to include the version number and update details in the Release description.
   - After publishing, users can search for and install your theme through Obsidian's theme settings interface (assuming your theme is on the Obsidian theme gallery).
   - For the steps, please refer to [Obsidian's official theme template release steps](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-theme?tab=readme-ov-file#steps-for-releasing-new-versions).
2. **Automatic Publishing**. Automatically publish using GitHub Actions. 
   - After you've built your theme, push it to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository and create a tag. GitHub Actions will then automatically run and publish the theme.
   - For specific steps, please refer to the [Obsidian official documentation](https://docs.obsidian.md/Themes/App+themes/Release+your+theme+with+GitHub+Actions).

### How to Modify the `versions.json` File?

In most cases, you don't need to modify this file.

If subsequent versions of your theme require a newer version of Obsidian to achieve the best experience, you can modify this file. The format of the file is as follows:

```json
{
   "1.0.0": "0.16.0",
   "2.0.0": "1.0.0"
}
```

Please note that according to Obsidian's rules, the version numbers used as keys refer to the version numbers of your theme, and the version numbers used as values refer to the version numbers of Obsidian. So if the new version of your theme is only compatible with an Insider version of Obsidian, it's important to set this value accordingly. This will prevent users on older versions of Obsidian from updating to the newer version of your theme.

## Why SCSS

SCSS (Sassy CSS) is an extension language of CSS that significantly enhances the maintainability and development efficiency of stylesheets by introducing variables, nesting, mixins, and other features. Its nested syntax mirrors HTML structure, making code more organized and readable. Variables simplify managing recurring values like colors and fonts, while mixins enable reusable style definitions, reducing redundancy. SCSS also supports mathematical operations, inheritance, modular file management, and control directives for complex logic, all while maintaining full compatibility with CSS, allowing gradual integration into existing projects.

Adopting SCSS streamlines code organization and flexibility, making it ideal for large-scale projects or collaborative teams. Its robust feature set and ecosystem tools (e.g., auto-compilation, code hints) improve developer experience, enabling the creation of cleaner, more maintainable stylesheets.

## Why Vite

Vite is a modern front-end build tool widely chosen for its features that significantly enhance the development experience: it leverages native ES modules and on-demand compilation to achieve sub-second cold starts, offers millisecond-level hot module replacement (HMR), has built-in support for JSX, TS, and CSS preprocessors, boasts a rich plugin ecosystem, supports multiple frameworks like Vue and React, and its production build is optimized via Rollup for code splitting and on-demand loading. Compared to traditional tools (such as Webpack), Vite features simpler configuration and faster startup speeds, making it particularly suitable for rapid iteration in small to medium-sized projects and performance optimization in large-scale projects, and it is an ideal choice for those pursuing efficient development workflows and integration with the modern front-end ecosystem.
